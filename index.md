SYLLABUS

Show what topics will be covered.

1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
intend to teach.
4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

This is one of the places where people frequently make mistakes, so
please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run

<div id="spreadsheet-program">
<h3>Spreadsheet program</h3>
  
<p>To interact with spreadsheets, we can use LibreOffice, Microsoft Excel, Gnumeric, OpenOffice.org, or other programs.
Commands may differ a bit between programs, but the general ideas for thinking about spreadsheets are the same. For this workshop,
we recommend using either Microsoft Excel (paid software) or LibreOffice (free and open source). Other spreadsheet programs may
not have all of the features we will be exploring in this workshop.</p>

<p>To install LibreOffice, go to their <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/">download page</a>. The website should
automatically select the correct option for your operating system. Click the “Download” button. You will go to a page that asks about a
donation, but you don’t need to make one. Your download should begin automatically. Once the installer is downloaded, double click on it (you may need to open your Downloads folder) and LibreOffice should install.</p>

  <h3>OpenRefine</h3>
  <p>
    For this lesson you will need <em>OpenRefine</em> and a
    web browser. <em>Note:</em> this is a Java program that runs on your machine (not in the cloud).
    It runs inside a web browser, but no web connection is needed.
